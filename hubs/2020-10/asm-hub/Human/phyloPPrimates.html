<p>
Primate-specific PhastCons per-base constraint scores. PhastCons is part of
the PHAST package, which uses a phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM)
to identify evolutionarily conserved elements. Model parameters were set to
match those used to generate the PhastCons output for the UCSC 100 Species
Vertebrate Multiz Alignment &nbsp;Conservation (expected-length=45,
target-coverage=0.3, rho= 0.31
http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&#103;=cons100way). Scores are
based on the alignment of the 43 primate genomes in the Zoonomia project.
